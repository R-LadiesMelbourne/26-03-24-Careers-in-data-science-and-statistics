On the 26th of March, R Ladies Melbourne Hosted a panel discussion focused on Careers in Data Science and Statistics. We were lucky enough to be joined by Di Cook, Lauren Smith, Evie Gizem and Goknur Giner.
 
Here we are summarising some of the key points and messages that our speakers generously shared with us.
 
**We wanted to know how our panelists stay up to date in the rapidly evolving field of coding, R packages and open source software.**
 
😎 you need to regularly work in your coding language, practice old skills and learn new ones too

🏃‍♀️Make an active effort to engage yourself in communities where you will get exposure to new packages, ways of coding and new ways of thinking about problems. Suggested groups to engage with are your local R Ladies Chapters - meetups and slack, R Ladies Global slack, other slack channels, twitter, attend conferences, discord, reddit ! Also talk to your peers and colleagues and make an effort to meet new people too. Learn with the demo data when a package has worked examples.

🧐 Find out why your code might give you warnings and messages about deprecations and changes in dependencies

🕵🏻‍♀️ Make sure you can navigate good and valid resources. If you’re hungry to learn, you’ll find the right resources…

**We next asked what our panelists use R for**

🤩 Everyone loves ggplot

🤖Understand the data you’re working with

📈 simulations, statistics, predictions, modeling…

🫶Lots of love for quarto, report automation, shiny … once you’re past exploratory phase, these tools can make your life a lot easier
 
**What advice did our panelists want to give to everyone wanting to pursue a career in data science?**

✍️ write an R package.

…And then submit applications to the Venables and Di Cook awards.

💫 Enter data challenges

🤖Contribute to open source community

🤨learn to feel comfortable with code not being perfect - know that you will always be improving - get used to never feeling completely confident

👀Make some decisions about what field of data science and statistics you want to pursue - make sure the jobs you are applying for can offer you what you want. Actively seek out roles that can help build your skills.

👩‍🎨 A solid foundation of data wrangling and statistics will take you a long way

🧑‍🚀 Make sure you are curious about the topic

**…and what were some of our panelists' favourite packages?**

💜 ggplot was a universal favourite

💥 beep has been particularly useful to multiple panelists…!

⚖️ edgeR, limma, tidyverse, glm

**Thanks again for joining, and see you next time!**
